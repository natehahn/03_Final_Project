## Investigative Query

1. Does the amount of agricultural production predict the CO2 emissions of a country?
2. What are the top (10) and low (10) products being produced by countries with higher CO2 emissions?
3. Can we predict the year based on CO2 emissions of a country?
4. Is there a correlation between region size and the rate of production impacting CO2 emissions? 
5. Is there a correlation between population and the rate of production impacting CO2 emissions?
