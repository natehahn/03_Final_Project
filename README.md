## Topic
**Food producation rates impacting CO2 emmisions based by countries**

## Datasets 

1. Database 1 CO2 Emissions by Country | Kaggle
2. Database 2 Environmental Impact of Food | Kaggle
3. Database 3 Population | WorldBank
4. Database 4 Emissons from Food | Enviormantal Impact of Food| Kaggle



## Description of Data


## Tools and Technologies 

## Machine Learning Models


## Investigative Query

1. Does the amount of agricultural production predict the CO2 emissions of a country?
2. What are the top (10) and low (10) products being produced by countries with higher CO2 emissions?
3. Can we predict the year based on CO2 emissions of a country?
4. Is there a correlation between region size and the rate of production impacting CO2 emissions? 
5. Is there a correlation between population and the rate of production impacting CO2 emissions?
