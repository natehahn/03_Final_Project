## Topic
**Food producation rates impacting CO2 emmisions based by countries**

## Datasets 

1. Database 1 **CO2 Emissions by Country | Kaggle** URL: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ggsri123/co2-emissions-from-fossil-fuels>
2. Database 2 **Environmental Impact of Food | Kaggle** <http://www.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfvivek/environment-impact-of-food-production>
3. Database 3 **Population | WorldBank** <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggleashwin/population-dataset>
4. Database 4 **Emissons from Food | Enviormantal Impact of Food| Kaggle**



## Description of Data
The datasets we will be examining in this analysis come from Kaggle and WorldBank report. We will be comparing the the relation of the product production impact on a countries CO2 emisson rates between the years 2000 to 2020



## Tools and Technologies 

## Machine Learning Model


## Investigative Query

1. Does the amount of agricultural production predict the CO2 emissions of a country?
2. What are the top (10) and low (10) products being produced by countries with higher CO2 emissions?
3. Can we predict the year based on CO2 emissions of a country?
4. Is there a correlation between region size and the rate of production impacting CO2 emissions? 
5. Is there a correlation between population and the rate of production impacting CO2 emissions?
